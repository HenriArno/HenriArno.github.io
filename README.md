# Henri Arno — Academic Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local development

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The website content lives mainly in:

- `_pages/about.md`
- `_pages/research.md`
- `_pages/teachingandtalks.md`
- `_config.yml`
- `_data/navigation.yml`
