I am an interdisciplinary PhD candidate at Ghent University as part of the [text-to-knowledge research group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) supervised by [prof. Thomas Demeester](https://tdmeeste.github.io/) (and co-supervised by [prof. Klaas Mulier](https://sites.google.com/site/mulierklaas/) and [prof. Joke Baeck](https://research.ugent.be/web/person/joke-baeck-0/nl)). Currently, I am working on a research project funded by the [Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)](https://researchportal.be/nl/project/causale-bayesiaanse-netwerken-en-neurale-netwerken-integreren-om-probabilistisch-te) focussed on estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from structured and unstructured data (e.g., electronic health records). More broadly, my research interest lies in data-driven decision support, particulary from unstructured data such as text. Previously, I had the opportunity to work on a [reasearch project](https://researchportal.be/nl/project/evaluatie-van-ondernemingen-moeilijkheden-door-gebruik-van-machine-learning-ontwikkeling) that aims to assist judges in enterprise court with the detection of financially distressed firms through predictive modelling, using the structured and unstructed data from annual accounts (among other data sources).
