I am an interdisciplinary PhD candidate at Ghent University, part of the [text-to-knowledge research group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/), with a research focus on data-driven decision support. My work, funded by the Research Foundation Flanders [(FWO)](https://researchportal.be/nl/project/causale-bayesiaanse-netwerken-en-neurale-netwerken-integreren-om-probabilistisch-te), centers on estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from structured and unstructured data (particularly text).

Background
======
My academic journey has been shaped by a broad interest in science and technology, which initially led me to pursue a B.Sc. in Business Engineering (a program organised by the faculty of economics with a strong quantitive component). During my undergraduate studies, I became increasingly interested in computer science, motivating me to enroll in the M.Sc. in Business Engineering: Data Analytics. After completing my masterâ€™s, I decided to join an interdisciplinary research program, where I contributed to a [research project](https://researchportal.be/nl/project/evaluatie-van-ondernemingen-moeilijkheden-door-gebruik-van-machine-learning-ontwikkeling) aimed at assisting judges in enterprise court with the detection of financially distressed firms through predictive modelling. During my first years as a researcher, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge on AI and machine learning through specialized courses. Recently, I was awarded a grant from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) to pursue fundamental research in causal machine learning, which is what I am working on today.
