I am an interdisciplinary PhD candidate at Ghent University, part of the [Text-to-Knowledge research group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/), working on data-driven decision support. My ongoing research, funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), involves estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from structured and unstructured data (particularly text). You can find my most recent paper on this topic [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15503). If you share similar research interests or if you are interested in potential collaborations, feel free to reach out!

Background
======
My academic journey started at the faculty of economics where I pursued a B.Sc. Business Engineering (a program with a strong quantitative component including courses such as operations research, statistics, econometrics, etc.). During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a two-year university-wide extracurricular program targeting motivated students with an interest in research. The lectures on computer science sparked my interest particularly, which motivated me to enroll in the M.Sc. Business Engineering: Data Analytics. After completing my masters, I joined an interdisciplinary research team where I contributed to a project aimed at assisting judges in enterprise court with the detection of financially distressed firms through predictive modeling. During this research project, I had the opportunity to follow specialised courses on machine learning, natural language processing, graphical models, etc. After working on this project for two years, I received a grant from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) allowing me to carry out fundamental research in causal machine learning, which is what I am working on today.
