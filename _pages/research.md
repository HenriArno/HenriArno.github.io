## Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation
**Description**: One of the central goals of causal machine learning is the accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data. These estimates can guide decision-making in critical areas such as personalised medicine and public policy. This research project centers on estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from both structured (tabular) and unstructured (textual) data.

**Example:** Many real-world applications involve unstructured data, making this research highly relevant. For example, doctors need to identify which patients will benefit most from specific treatments to allocate them effectively. The necessary data for estimating these effects can be found in electronic medical records, where diagnostic information is recorded in clinical notes writen by physicians while patient background conditions are stored as tabular data.

## Detection of financially distressed firms through predictive modelling
**Description**: In Belgium, each commercial court has one or more Chambers for Companies in Difficulty (CCDs) that detect, investigate and monitor financially distressed companies. Recognizing the inefficiencies of manually selection, the goal of this project is to assist the judges of the commercial courts in the detection of companies in financial distress through predictive modelling. To this end, we have developed and evaluated several models to detect financial distress from both the numerical accounting data and the textual disclosures in corporate filings.
