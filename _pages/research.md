## Causal inference from unstructured data
**Description**: One of the central goals of causal machine learning is the accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data. These estimates can guide decision-making in critical areas like personalised medicine and public policy. This research project is focused on the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from both structured (tabular) and unstructured (textual) data.

<!--- **Example:** In personalised medicine, doctors need to identify which patients will benefit most from specific medical treatments in order to allocate them effectively. The data required for estimating these treatment effects can be found in electronic medical records, where diagnostic information is recorded in clinical notes and patient background conditions are stored as tabular data. Given the prevalence of such structured and unstructured data in many real-world applications, we believe that this research track holds lots of potential from theory to practice.

## Detection of financially distressed firms through predictive modeling
**Description**: In Belgium, each commercial court has one or more Chambers for Companies in Difficulty (CCDs) that detect, investigate and monitor financially distressed companies. Recognizing the inefficiencies of manually selection, the goal of this project is to assist the judges of the commercial courts in the detection of companies in financial distress through predictive modeling. To this end, we have developed and evaluated several models to detect financial distress from both the numerical accounting data and the textual disclosures in corporate filings.
