### Causal Machine Learning
My core research develops causal inference methods for data-driven decision support. I study treatment effect estimation, ranking and policy learning from observational data, with potentially complex input modalities such as text. This line of work combines theory with realistic data properties for reliable decision support systems. [Scholar](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=ce8BmFgAAAAJ&hl=nl) is always up-to-date.

### ML-based Decision Support for Commercial Court 
During a two-year interdisciplinary research project, I developed machine learning systems to support Belgian commercial courts in the early detection of financially distressed firms. This work combined structured accounting data and textual corporate disclosures, with an emphasis on performance and interpretability. The project bridged machine learning methodology with legal and economic expertise.
